# Mongoose
- it helps us to established a connection between node.js and mongodb.

- Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) libray for MongoDB and Node.js is manages relationships data. Provide Schema Validation, and is used to translate between "objects" in code and the representation fo those objects in MongoDB.
- It Provides an abstraction layer on top of MongoDB that eliminates the need to use named collaction.
